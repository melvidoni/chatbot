# Chatbot IA
This is an intelligent agent that works as a chatbot: a soft-bot (software-based robot) that can chat with the user.
It is a search based agent, and is capable of understanding and answering only the questions that are stored on its knowledge. Since that knowledge is written on simple plain text files, it can be easily changed.
The bot is also able to display the interface, basic extra answers, and store the chat record in English or Spanish. The default is Spanish, but it can be changed from the main interface during runtime.


## Getting Started
The project was developed on IntelliJ IDEA, with Java8 and JavaFX, and extends FAIA. You can get the latest working source code from the master branch.

### Prerequisities
The agent is only available for Windows, and the PC must have the [Java JDK 8u102] (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) installed before the agent can be executed.

### Installing
To install the chatbot, follow the next steps:
1. Download the latest release from [the repository] (https://gitlab.com/mvingar/chatbot/tags)
1. Uncompress the *.rar file with "Extract here".
1. Go to your system's drive (C:/)
1. Copy the folder Chatbot. It should be located on C:\Chatbot.
1. Run the application from Chatbot.exe
You can create a desktop shortcut for the file Chatbot.exe by right clicking it, then select "Send to", then "Desktop (create shortcut)".
